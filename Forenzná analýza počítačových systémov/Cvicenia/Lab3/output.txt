1.Download, verify and mount image Lab3.E01
2.Analyze partition table - partition 1. 
	Where does it start, how big is it, what FS, what OS formatted the drive? Any other metadata?
	Start = 2048 sector
	End = 204800 sector
	Size = 202753 sectors
	FS = 	fdisk -l 	-> FAT16
		mmls 		-> DOS FAT16
		fsstat		-> FAT16
	OS = mkfs.fat -> Linux tool so LINUX (my guess not based on evidence is SIFT)
3.Your job is to find password for perpetrators keychain stored in text file.
	1. During routine check for unllocated blocks found with command:
		blkls /dev/mapper/loop19p1 | xxd | grep -v "0000 0000 0000" | less
	Wierd sentence: heslo na klucenku je v6Jc3p8VRau
	2. Going deeper and searching for deleted files with:
		ils -em -o 2048 -f fat /mnt/ewf/ewf1
		a. Found file: _ECRET~1.swp-dead-65417
		b. inspecting inode: istat -o 2048 /mnt/ewf/ewf1 65417
		c. inspecting inode as suggested druing class 65416 -> file .secret.txt.s
		d. getting content of inode 65417
		e. Using command icat /dev/mapper/loop19p1 65417 | xxd | less found at the of
		the file again the same sentence with password
		f. done in this section probably continue to point 4
4.Document everything about all files on the FS and build timeline.
	1. testing fls command from last session
		fls -m C: -r /dev/mapper/loop19p1 > usb1.fls
	2. timeline built using command:
		mactime -b usb1.fls
5.Which files do you suspect might contain sensitive information?
	1. As described before secret.txt has sensitive info
	2. pwdecrypt -> event tried to run this on VM but without any success
	3. passwd -> used icat with 65414, regulat passwd file as on all linuxes
	4. Tried few different files without any further succes (inodes 4, 65422, 65419, 65416)
6.Were the files modified or tampered in any way?
	1. after running machine -b usb1.fls following files / folders where modified / hard deleted
		a. C:/tmp/.secret.txt.swp (deleted)
		b. C:/tmp/_ (hard deleted through wipe)
		c. C:/tmp/_0(hard deleted through wipe)
		d. C:/tmp/_0000000(hard deleted through wipe)
		e. C:/tmp/_00000~1(hard deleted through wipe)
		f. C:/tmp/_ECRET~1.SWX(deleted)
7.Is there a way for you to find the information anyways?
	1. about hard deleted files i am not aware of any method
	2. about normal deleted files i got "heslo na klucenku je ..."
